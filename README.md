# terrain

Carves rivers into terrain by simulating particles of 'water' which carve paths and follow paths previously
carved. 

Run 'water 1.6'

Controls:
 - left click to create partices
 - right click to flip terrain
 - s to average terrain with original terrain
 - d to reset whole terrain and points

Future developments:
 - support loading own terrain files as images
 - change particle interaction to have an amount of 'sediment' held, increased when carving and deposited
   when going slow to more represent river mechanics
